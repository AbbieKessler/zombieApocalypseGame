<h1> Neighbor</h1>
<img src="">
<p>Jinx provided a few meals, but you are sick with grief over your furry friend.
        To conserve energy, you have been sleeping a lot, but the pain of hunger becomes more noticeable every day. 
        While lying in bed, a rapid knock and familiar voice beg you to let them inside.
        Overcome with joy, you let an old neighbor into your house. 
        He seems grateful to be inside, but there's something off about him. 
        A feverish sheen coats his forehead and there is a pungent stench coming from his back.
        He is asking for food and to stay for a few nights.</p>
