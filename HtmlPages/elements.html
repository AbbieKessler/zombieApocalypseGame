<h1> Death: Elements</h1>
<img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/02/09/05/56/360_F_209055685_aJ5YSOZZbPyp8xZoGFerO0WJ3ezTq4BH.jpg">
<p>You have died from the elements. 
        The undead will soon find your corpse and have a feast. 
</p>

<p>Find your last decision to determine how you died:
        Stay in cave: The temperature dropped too low and you slowly froze to death. 
        Abandoned Barn: You make it to the barn, but there is no roof or protection from the wind. 
        A cold drizzle begins and hypothermia sets in. 
        You survive the night, but the damage is done. You die the next afternoon.
