<p>Your kind heart got the best of you, and you decided to let the neighbor stay.
        You are still unsure of his odd behavior and state, but you chalk it up to the stress of surviving the end of the world.
        The neighbor keeps begging for food and gets irritated that you do not have anything to give him.
        He complains of feeling sick and extremely hungry. Later when he is asleep, you get curious and look at his back to find out where the smell is coming from. 
        A huge festering bite is on the middle of his back. He will surely turn in the next few hours.</p>
