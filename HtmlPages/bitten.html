<h1> Death: Bitten</h1>
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjNiMDE4NTMtMTY5Yy00ZGI4LTk0MWYtNzMxNjU4YzRiN2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg">
<p>You have been bitten by the undead and turn. 
        You are now one of the ravenous monsters roaming the streets for their next victim.
 </p>
 <p>Find your last decision to determine how you were bit: 
        Help Neighbor: You attempted to save the neighbor by cutting out the infected area. 
        This only causes him to turn faster. There is no place to run in your small house, and the neighbor soon finds your hiding spot.
        Machete: You tried to conserve ammo by using the machete. 
        Unfortunately you have never used a machete before and could not kill the turned before it overcame you. 
        Become a Fighter: You are not a very good fighter. 
        On the first mission, you trip and fall while leading the undead away from the other fighters. 
        By the time the others reach you, you are too far gone.
        </p>
