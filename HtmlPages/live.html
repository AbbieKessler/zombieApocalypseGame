<p>You have survived the Apocalypse!</p>

<p>Find your previous answer to see your fate: 
        Kept moving: You decided to keep moving to stay warm. While stumbling through the woods you uncover a secret bunker. 
        There are a few people inside but they are friendly and welcome you. The bunker is well built and has enough supplies to last years. 
        Keep searching for food: You made it into town to look for food. While meandering through the street a government bus full of other survivors picks you up. 
        They take you back to the nearby base for protection. Additional precautions are made and the base becomes a safe and closed community.
