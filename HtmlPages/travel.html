<p>You decide to leave and begin searching for a new place to stay.
         While crossing a field you hear a shout. As you turn to look, a large man approaches.
         His shuffling steps, low gurgling noises, and incapacitating stench signify he has been turned.
         Then you hear the shout again but are unable to discern where it originates. 
         Suddenly, a shot cuts through the air, the man collapses. 
         A group of others approach you. Theyâ€™re alive, but look like they have had a rough time evading the undead.
         Despite their appearances, they seem friendly.

<p>Do you choose to </p> <a href="./continue.html">keep moving on your own?</a>
