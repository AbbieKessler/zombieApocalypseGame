<p>You move through the dark woods quickly to get as far away from the others as possible.
        It's getting late and the undead become more active at night. 
        It is almost as if the moon places a curse on them causing a ravenous hunger and unending endurance. 
        You need to find shelter to survive the night. 
        Upahead you see an abandoned barn, but it is across an open field.</p>

<p>Do you choose to </p> <a href="./elements.html">risk being seen by the turned and go to the abandoned barn?</a>
<p>Do you choose to </p> <a href="./fire.html">remain in the woods and look for shelter?</a>
