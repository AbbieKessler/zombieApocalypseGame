<p>You get lucky in the woods and find a small natural cave. 
        The rock walls offer good protection and the entrance can be easily blocked. 
        The bad part about being surrounded by rocks is: they are freezing. 
        Starting a fire would keep you warm, but you would have to leave the entrance open to allow for ventilation.</p>

<p>Do you choose to </p> <a href="./murdered.html">have a fire?</a>
<p>Do you choose to </p> <a href="./movement.html">deal with the cold?</a>
