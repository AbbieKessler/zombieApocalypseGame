<h1> Stay</h1>
<img src="">
<p>You chose to stay in your small house. 
        The constant screams and the smell of death is overwhelming. 
        The dead are becoming smarter; they broke down your neighbor’s door and turned them all. 
        Your flimsy door can not withstand an attack, but you are also concerned about food. 
        It’s been a week since the undead took over and the few cans of vegetables and soup will not last much longer.</p>

<p>Do you choose to </p> <a href="./reinforce.html">stay and reinforce your house?</a>
<p>Do you choose to </p> <a href="./encounter.html">venture out to find food?</a>
