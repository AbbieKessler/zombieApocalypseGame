<h1> Death: Murdered</h1>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSfQvJuHCOEN51K59URF_3Xw1_9hGXMP8IiWQ&s">
<p>You have been murdered by an alive person. 
        The lack of morals since the end of the world means there will be no avenging your death.
</p>

<p>
        Find your last decision to see how you died.
        Make a fire: The fire warms you up, but the light and smoke make you noticeable. 
        The group of survivors you ran into earlier find you. 
        They decide they want your supplies, so they shoot you and steal the meager tools and food you possess. 
        Lie: You decide to lie about poisoning the leader. 
        As the newest member, your account is not taken seriously, and they decide your punishment is death by hanging. 
        Own up: You own up to poisoning the leader after 3 nights of torture. 
        Since you told the truth the others grant you a quick death. 
        You are taken outside and shot.  
        Kick out neighbor: You confront your neighbor about the bite and he denies having it. 
        He gets angry after telling him to leave. In his anger, he picks up a large vase and breaks it over your head. 
        The uncontrollable bleeding leads to your death.
